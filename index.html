    <h1>The story in the book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>Molly had been staring out her window for about a hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Sceintist</i>,and all the other sceintific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she spent these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
    <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q> Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="deoxyriboncleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>
